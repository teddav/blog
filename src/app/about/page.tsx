          These days, I&apos;m deep into cryptography: zero-knowledge proofs, MPC, FHE. Interested in building privacy-preserving
          applications.
          <br />
          My work focuses on exploring the boundaries of what&apos;s possible with modern cryptographic techniques.
          <br />
          I used to do DevSecOps for Big Tech, now I&apos;m more excited about low-level stuff like assembly and wasm.
          <br />
          I also worked on smart contract security and the EVM, having fun with solidity and yul.
          <br />I work at the intersection of zero-knowledge, smart contract security, and cryptographic engineering.
